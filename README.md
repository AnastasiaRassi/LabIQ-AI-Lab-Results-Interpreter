# Blood Test AI Interpreter

## Overview

This project extracts text from blood test images and automatically generates structured reports and visual dashboards using AI. It combines:

1. **OCR** with PaddleOCR to read test results from images.
2. **Preprocessing** to enhance image quality for OCR.
3. **LLM-based reporting** to interpret results in natural language.
4. **Dashboards** to visualize trends and key metrics across multiple tests.
